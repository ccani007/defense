	abstract = {Objective: This study aimed to develop a prediction model for suicide attempts in Korean adolescents. Methods: We conducted a decision tree analysis of 2,754 middle and high school students nationwide. We fixed suicide attempt as the dependent variable and eleven sociodemographic, intrapersonal, and extrapersonal variables as independent variables. Results: The rate of suicide attempts of the total sample was 9.5\%, and severity of depression was the strongest variable to predict suicide attempt. The rates of suicide attempts in the depression and potential depression groups were 5.4 and 2.8 times higher than that of the nondepression group. In the depression group, the most powerful factor to predict a suicide attempt was delinquency, and the rate of suicide attempts in those in the depression group with higher delinquency was two times higher than in those in the depression group with lower delinquency. Of special note, the rate of suicide attempts in the depressed females with higher delinquency was the highest. Interestingly, in the potential depression group, the most impactful factor to predict a suicide attempt was intimacy with family, and the rate of suicide attempts of those in the potential depression group with lower intimacy with family was 2.4 times higher than that of those in the potential depression group with higher intimacy with family. And, among the potential depression group, middle school students with lower intimacy with family had a 2.5-times higher rate of suicide attempts than high school students with lower intimacy with family. Finally, in the non-depression group, stress level was the most powerful factor to predict a suicide attempt. Among the non-depression group, students who reported high levels of stress showed an 8.3-times higher rate of suicide attempts than students who reported average levels of stress. Discussion: Based on the results, we especially need to pay attention to depressed females with higher delinquency and those with potential depression with lower intimacy with family to prevent suicide attempts in teenagers.},

In addition, recent innovations in suicide research methods may similarly expand our understanding of the psychological and neurobiological correlates of suicidal thoughts and behaviors. This review discusses the limitations and challenges associated with current methods of suicide risk assessment and presents new techniques currently being developed to measure rapid changes in suicidal thoughts and behavior. These novel assessment strategies include ecological momentary assessment, digital phenotyping, cognitive and implicit bias metrics, and neuroimaging paradigms and analysis methodologies to identify neural circuits associated with suicide risk. This review is intended to both describe the current state of our ability to assess rapid changes in suicide risk as well as to explore future directions for clinical, neurobiological, and computational markers research in suicide-focused clinical trials.},

	abstract = {Objective: To analyze suicidal behavior and build a predictive model for suicide risk using data mining (DM) analysis.
Methods: A study of 707 Chilean mental health patients (with and without suicide risk) was carried out across three healthcare centers in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, Chile. Three hundred fortythree variables were studied using ﬁve questionnaires. DM and machine-learning tools were used via the support vector machine technique.
Results: The model selected 22 variables that, depending on the circumstances in which they all occur, deﬁne whether a person belongs in a suicide risk zone (accuracy = 0.78, sensitivity = 0.77, and speciﬁcity = 0.79). Being in a suicide risk zone means patients are more vulnerable to suicide attempts or are thinking about suicide. The interrelationship between these variables is highly nonlinear, and it is interesting to note the particular ways in which they are conﬁgured for each case. The model shows that the variables of a suicide risk zone are related to individual unrest, personal satisfaction, and reasons for living, particularly those related to beliefs in one’s own capacities and coping abilities.
Conclusion: These variables can be used to create an assessment tool and enables us to identify individual risk and protective factors. This may also contribute to therapeutic intervention by strengthening feelings of personal well-being and reasons for staying alive. Our results prompted the design of a new clinical tool, which is fast and easy to use and aids in evaluating the trajectory of suicide risk at a given moment.},

Given these ﬁndings, research has begun to evaluate the features of this multifaceted behavior that may be most important to assess when quantifying risk for SI, SP, and SA. However, no studies have examined the wide range of NSSI characteristics simultaneously when determining which NSSI features are most salient to suicide risk. The current study utilized three exploratory data mining techniques (elastic net regression, decision trees, random forests) to address these gaps in the literature. Undergraduates with a history of NSSI (N = 359) were administered measures assessing demographic variables, depression, and 58 NSSI characteristics (e.g., methods, frequency, functions, locations, scarring) as well as current SI, current SP, and SA history. Results suggested that depressive symptoms and the anti-suicide function of NSSI were the most important features for predicting SI and SP. The most important features in predicting SA were the anti-suicide function of NSSI, NSSI-related medical treatment, and NSSI scarring. Overall, results suggest that NSSI functions, scarring, and medical lethality may be more important to assess than commonly regarded NSSI severity indices when ascertaining suicide risk.},

	abstract = {Background: Machine learning techniques oﬀer promise to improve suicide risk prediction. In the current systematic review, we aimed to review the existing literature on the application of machine learning techniques to predict self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (SITBs).
Method: We systematically searched PsycINFO, PsycARTICLES, ERIC, CINAHL, and MEDLINE for articles published through February 2018.
Results: Thirty-ﬁve articles met criteria to be included in the review. Included articles were reviewed by outcome: suicide death, suicide attempt, suicide plan, suicidal ideation, suicide risk, and non-suicidal self-injury. We observed three general aims in the use of SITB-focused machine learning analyses: (1) improving prediction accuracy, (2) identifying important model indicators (i.e., variable selection) and indicator interactions, and (3) modeling underlying subgroups. For studies with the aim of boosting predictive accuracy, we observed greater prediction accuracy of SITBs than in previous studies using traditional statistical methods. Studies using machine learning for variable selection purposes have both replicated ﬁndings of well-known SITB risk factors and identiﬁed novel variables that may augment model performance. Finally, some of these studies have allowed for subgroup identiﬁcation, which in turn has helped to inform clinical cutoﬀs. Limitations: Limitations of the current review include relatively low paper sample size, inconsistent reporting procedures resulting in an inability to compare model accuracy across studies, and lack of model validation on external samples.
Conclusions: We concluded that leveraging machine learning techniques to further predictive accuracy and identify novel indicators will aid in the prediction and prevention of suicide.},

While quantifiable improvements in prediction accuracy have been achieved over theorydriven efforts, models discovered through machine learning continue to fall short of clinical relevance. Thus, the value of machine learning for reaching this objective is hotly contested. We agree that machine learning, treated as a “black box” approach antithetical to theory-building, will not discover clinically relevant models of suicide. However, such models may be developed through deliberate synthesis of data- and theory-driven ap­ proaches. By providing an accessible overview of essential concepts and common methods, we highlight how generalizable models and scientific insight may be obtained by incorporating prior knowledge and expectations to machine learning research, drawing examples from suicidology. We then discuss challenges investigators will face when using machine learning to discover models of low prevalence outcomes, such as suicide.},

These tests are built in a standard way, disregarding useful and usually available information not included in the assessment scales that could increase the precision and utility of CATs, such as the history of suicide attempts.
Methods: Using the items of a previously developed scale for suicidal risk, we compared the performance of a standard CAT and a decision tree in a support decision system to identify suicidal behavior. We included the history of past suicide attempts as a class for the separation of patients in the decision tree.
Results: The decision tree needed an average of four items to achieve a similar accuracy than a standard CAT with nine items. The accuracy of the decision tree, obtained after 25 cross-validations, was 81.4\%. A shortened test adapted for the separation of suicidal and non-suicidal patients was developed.
Conclusion: CATs can be very useful tools for the assessment of suicidal risk. However, standard CATs do not use all the information that is available. A decision tree can improve the precision of the assessment since they are constructed using a priori information.},

This work is a systematic review of research papers published in the last ten years on technology for suicide prevention. In September 2017, the consultation was carried out in the scientific databases PubMed, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. A general search was conducted with the terms “prevention” AND “suicide” AND "technology. More specific searches included technologies such as "Web”, “mobile”, “social networks”, and others terms related to technologies. The number of articles found following the methodology proposed was 90, but only 30 are focused on the objective of this work. Most of them were Web technologies (51.61\%), mobile solutions (22.58\%), social networks (12.90\%), machine learning (3.23\%) and other technologies (9.68\%). According to the results obtained, although there are technological solutions that help the prevention of suicide, much remains to be done in this field. Collaboration among technologists, psychiatrists, patients, and family members is key to advancing the development of new technology-based solutions that can help save lives.},

To create a classiﬁer for SI based on variables of the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) and sociodemographic variables, and to obtain an upper bound on the best possible performance of a predictor based on those variables.
Methods: From a consecutive sample of 9025 primary care patients, 6805 eligible patients (60\% female; mean age = 51.5 years) participated. Advanced methods of machine learning were used to derive the prediction equation. Various classiﬁers were applied and the area under the curve (AUC) was computed as a performance measure.
Results: Classiﬁers based on methods of machine learning outperformed ordinary regression methods and achieved AUCs around 0.87. The key variables in the prediction equation comprised four items - namely feelings of depression/hopelessness, low self-esteem, worrying, and severe sleep disturbances. The generalized anxiety disorder scale (GAD-7) and the somatic symptom subscale (PHQ-15) did not enhance prediction substantially.
Conclusions: In predicting suicidal ideation researchers should refrain from using ordinary regression tools. The relevant information is primarily captured by the depression subscale and should be incorporated in a nonlinear model. For clinical practice, a classiﬁcation tree using only four items of the whole PHQ may be advocated.},

	abstract = {Background: In spite of the high prevalence of suicide behaviours and the magnitude of the resultant burden, little is known about why individuals reattempt. We aim to investigate the relationships between clinical risk factors and the repetition of suicidal attempts.
Methods: 1349 suicide attempters were consecutively recruited in the Emergency Room (ER) of two academic hospitals in France and Spain. Patients were extensively assessed and demographic and clinical data obtained. Data mining was used to determine the minimal number of variables that blinded the rest in relation to the number of suicide attempts. Using this set, a probabilistic graph ranking relationships with the target variable was constructed.
Results: The most common diagnoses among suicide attempters were affective disorders, followed by anxiety disorders. Risk of frequent suicide attempt was highest among middle-aged subjects, and diminished progressively with advancing age of onset at ﬁrst attempt. Anxiety disorders signiﬁcantly increased the risk of presenting frequent suicide attempts. Pathway analysis also indicated that frequent suicide attempts were linked to greater odds for alcohol and substance abuse disorders and more intensive treatment.
Conclusions: Novel statistical methods found several clinical features that were associated with a history of frequent suicide attempts. The identiﬁed pathways may promote new hypothesis-driven studies of suicide attempts and preventive strategies.},

As a result, nano/micro bimodal powder has been introduced to overcome such problems. In this study, the effects of nano powder ratio in nano/micro bimodal powder on powder metallurgy process have been investigated. The master sintering curves for the bimodal powders were also developed for the ﬁrst time. With micro, nano and 3 different bimodal powders, compaction behavior was investigated, and dilatometric sintering was carried out to analyze the densiﬁcation behavior during the sintering process. The results showed bimodal powders had relatively high green density, and the highest value was obtained with 25\% nano bimodal powder. The powder also provided the highest densiﬁcation parameter. Based on the dilatometer data, the master sintering curves of each powder were constructed, and all curves were consistent with experimental data.},

abstract = {Background and objectives Suicide mortality has not decreased in recent decades, partly due to the lack of valid predictors. A small number of systematic reviews have been published on the different integrated theoretical models of suicide, although no attempts have been made to bring together the different perspectives into a single integrated model.
Methods
We performed a systematic search of the PubMed and EMBASE databases up to January 2020 to identify studies on integrated theoretical models of suicidal behaviour.
Results
Eleven articles met the selection criteria and were included in the review. Some of the key risk factors indicated by most of the models are traumatic events, childhood abuse, feelings of defeat and entrapment, emotional dysregulation, and social exclusion.
Conclusions
Suicidal behaviour remains a complex phenomenon involving multiple factors. The synergistic effect between all the factors involved should be considered.}

   abstract = {Research has supported an association between suicidal thoughts/behaviors and risk taking, which may be particularly strong during adolescence when risk taking is known to increase. However, extant research has focused on individual risk-taking behaviors (e.g., alcohol use), limiting our ability to evaluate the unique association between different risk-taking behaviors and suicidal thoughts/behaviors. The current study aimed to fill this gap by examining the simultaneous influence of multiple risk-taking behaviors (i.e., risky sexual behavior, tobacco/alcohol use, illicit drug use, delinquent behavior, violent behavior) on adolescent suicidal thoughts/behaviors. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health was utilized. The sample consisted of 4,834 adolescents who completed home interviews at two time points. At the first time point, participants' mean age was 15.15, with 48% (n = 2,315) identifying as male. Participants provided information about suicidal thoughts/behaviors and multiple risk-taking behaviors at an initial interview and at a second interview, approximately 11 months later. When independently examined, nearly all assessed risk-taking behaviors were independently associated with suicidal ideation concurrently and prospectively, and with suicide attempts concurrently. When all risk-taking behaviors were examined simultaneously, illicit drug use was the only significant concurrent and significant prospective, albeit negative, predictor of suicidal thoughts and only concurrent predictor of suicidal behavior. The current findings suggest that illicit drug use may have a stronger association with suicidal thoughts and behaviors than other risk-taking behavior. These findings have implications for prevention and intervention programs for adolescents.},

abstract={A revised and refined version of the O'Carroll et al. (1996) nomenclature for suicidology is presented, with a focus on suicide-related ideations, communications, and behaviors. The hope is that this refinement will result in the development of operational definitions and field testing of this nomenclature in clinical and research settings. This revision would not have been possible without the international collaboration and dialogue addressing the nomenclature of suicidology since the O'Carroll et al. nomenclature appeared in 1996. Although it is doubtful that we will ever be able to construct universally unambiguous criteria to comprehensively characterize suicidal behaviors (and, overall, firmly establish the intention behind them), for scientific clarity it would be highly desirable that the set of definitions and the associated terminology be explicit and generalizable.

   abstract = {Suicidal behaviour refers to the occurrence of self-directed injurious acts with intent to end one's own life. Suicide is not simply a response to stress, but is a complication of an existing psychiatric disorder.Many models of suicidal behaviour have been put forward. This article presents a stress–diathesis model in which a stressor leads to the acute worsening of a psychiatric disorder, leading to suicidal behaviour. Many factors are components of the diathesis for suicidal behaviour. They include pessimism, aggression, impulsivity, familial/genetic factors and childhood experiences.Most of the neurochemical evidence, particularly evidence obtained from the brains of suicide victims, points to the involvement of the serotonergic system in suicidal behaviour. The noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems have also been implicated, but the evidence is more fragmentary.As a result of the neurochemical observations, the genetic study of suicidal behaviour has centred on the study of genes that govern the function of the serotonergic system. Although different polymorphisms in the genes that encode tryptophan hydroxylase, the serotonin transporter, the different serotonin receptors and monoamine oxidase have been found, their relationship to suicidal behaviour remains unclear.Neuroanatomically, people who display suicidal behaviour tend to show abnormalities in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. These abnormalities largely correlate with the neurochemical deficits that have been reported in this population.The diathesis of suicidal behaviour offers new therapeutic possibilities. However, these are still early days in the study of suicide, and it will be important to identify additional markers (genetic, anatomical and neuropsychological) for identifying people at risk of showing suicidal behaviour.},

The second describes in detail how to assess borderline patients and how to organize and prioritize treatment goals and behavioral targets. . . . For problem solving with borderline personality disorder, the book provides specific strategies for contingency management, exposure, cognitive modification, and skills training. The last component is further elucidated in the companion "Skills Training Manual." Addressing the most stressful patient behaviors that clinicians encounter, the book includes a step-by-step outline for assessing suicide risk, managing suicide threats, and working with chronic suicidal behavior.

New significant risk factors (being offered illegal drugs at school, being abused by a boyfriend/girlfriend, gender, and ethnicity) were identified for suicidal attempt in adolescents. Patterns of risk behaviors differed among male and female groups. Several new risk behaviors associated with suicide attempt in adolescents were identified. There were notable differences in risk behaviors between two gender groups, especially in the area of depression. These findings could have potentially important implications for preventing adolescent suicide attempts.},

ABSTRACT={Purpose: Suicide is the second leading cause of death among high school aged students in the United States. Significant risk factors for suicidal behaviors among youth include diagnoses of depression or other mental illnesses. The association between self-reported sad feelings and suicidal behaviors has been understudied in the literature among United States high school students.Methods: The 2019 National Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) school-based questionnaire, coordinated by the CDC, captured a nationally-representative sample (N = 13,677) of students' responses to health-related behaviors. National sex-stratified prevalences of sad feelings and suicidal behaviors were calculated. Adjusted weighted logistic regression was used to examine the association between self-reported sad feelings and suicidal behaviors.Results: Out of 13,677 high-school students, 35.8% of students self-reported sad feelings. Suicidal behaviors in the overall sample included 18.2% had seriously considered suicide, 15.2% made a plan on how they would attempt suicide, and 7.3% attempted suicide within the past 12 months. There was an 8–11-fold increased odds of all suicidal behaviors among those who reported sad feelings among both females and males.Conclusions: This study reveals a remarkably high prevalence of sad feelings among US youth, and underscores a significant association between self-reported sad feelings and suicidal behaviors among this population. The YRBS survey, routinely administered across US high school students, should be better leveraged to target interventions toward these high-risk youth in order to decrease the significant burden of suicidal behaviors among adolescents.}

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Suicide is a leading cause of death and a complex clinical outcome. Here, we summarize the current state of research pertaining to suicidal thoughts and behaviors in youth. We review their definitions/measurement and phenomenology, epidemiology, potential etiological mechanisms, and psychological treatment and prevention efforts. RESULTS: We identify key patterns and gaps in knowledge that should guide future work. Regarding epidemiology, the prevalence of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth varies across countries and sociodemographic populations. Despite this, studies are rarely conducted cross-nationally and do not uniformly account for high-risk populations. Regarding etiology, the majority of risk factors have been identified within the realm of environmental and psychological factors (notably negative affect-related processes), and most frequently using self-report measures. Little research has spanned across additional units of analyses including behavior, physiology, molecules, cells, and genes. Finally, there has been growing evidence in support of select psychotherapeutic treatment and prevention strategies, and preliminary evidence for technology-based interventions. CONCLUSIONS: There is much work to be done to better understand suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth. We strongly encourage future research to: (1) continue improving the conceptualization and operationalization of suicidal thoughts and behaviors; (2) improve etiological understanding by focusing on individual (preferably malleable) mechanisms; (3) improve etiological understanding also by integrating findings across multiple units of analyses and developing short-term prediction models; (4) demonstrate greater developmental sensitivity overall; and (5) account for diverse high-risk populations via sampling and reporting of sample characteristics. These serve as initial steps to improve the scientific approach, knowledge base, and ultimately prevention of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth.},

METHODS: We used latent class regression analysis of Rhode Island's 2007 YRBS data (from a random sample of 2210 public high school students) to model latent classes of suicide risk and identify predictors of latent class membership. RESULTS: Four latent classes of suicide risk were modeled and predictors were associated with each: class 1 (emotionally healthy, 74%); class 2 (considered and planned suicide, 14%) was associated with being female, having low grades, being gay/lesbian/bisexual/unsure, feeling unsafe at school, having experienced forced sexual intercourse, and self-perceived overweight; class 3 (attempted suicide, 6%) was associated with speaking a language other than English at home, being gay/lesbian/bisexual/unsure, feeling unsafe at school, and forced sexual intercourse; and class 4 (planned and attempted suicide, 6%) was associated with the previously mentioned predictors and with being in 9th or 10th grade and currently smoking. CONCLUSIONS: A single model characterized and quantified 4 patterns of suicide risk among adolescents and identified predictors for 3 at-risk classes.

   abstract = {Objective: The purpose of this research was to investigate the prevalence of lifestyle behaviors and suicide-related behaviors and the association between them using a nationally representative sample of adolescents from the USA. Methods: 13,677 high school students aged 14-18 years were included in this cross-sectional study. The research data were retrieved from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System Survey in 2019. All data on age, sex, grade, race, physical activity, television time, fruit intake, and suicide-related behavior were self-reported by students. Logistic regression models were adopted to examine the association between lifestyle behaviors and the suicide-related behaviors. Results: Students who played video/computer games for ≥2 h had higher risk of suicide attempt (OR = 1.55, 95%CI: 1.30-1.85). Daily sleep duration of ≤8 h was positively associated with considering a suicide attempt (OR = 1.99, 95%CI: 1.62-2.43). In addition, participants who did not engage in any sport team were more likely to report considering a suicide attempt (OR = 1.50, 95%CI: 1.24-1.81). Conclusion: This research suggests that some lifestyle behaviors (e.g., time for video or computer use, sleep duration, sports team participation, regular breakfast intake, and substance use) are associated with increased risk of suicidal behavior and ideation in high school students. To identify the specific effect of multiple lifestyle factors in influencing the risk of suicide-related behaviors in high school students, longitudinal studies are warranted in future.},

ABSTRACT={<sec>ImportancePrior research has shown a statistically significant association between sustaining a concussion and suicidality in adolescents, but this prior research controlled for relatively few variables predictive of suicidality.</sec><sec>ObjectiveTo examine whether sustaining a concussion remained a significant predictor of suicidality after controlling for relevant covariates (e.g., sexual abuse/assault, bullying, substance use, depression), hypothesizing that the relationship between concussion and suicidality would become non-significant after controlling for these variables.</sec><sec>DesignThis study involved secondary data analysis of the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance (YRBS) System, a national cross-sectional study of adolescents. Analyses were stratified by gender.</sec><sec>SettingA national sampling of U.S. high school students.</sec><sec>ParticipantsEleven thousand two hundred sixty-two students in the YRBS database, including 5,483 boys and 5,779 girls.</sec><sec>Exposure(s)Participants included in the analyses reported whether, in the last year, they experienced a concussion and/or suicidality.</sec><sec>Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe main outcome was suicidality (i.e., ideation, planning, attempt), which was predicted by concussion in an unadjusted analysis and by concussion along with other risk factors in a multivariable analysis.</sec><sec>ResultsThe final sample included 11,262 participants with available data on concussion and suicidality in the last year (14–18 years-old; 51.3% girls; 49.0% White). Per unadjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals, there was a relationship between concussion and suicidal ideation [girls: OR = 1.46 (1.24, 1.73); boys: OR = 1.69 (1.41, 2.03)], planning (girls: OR = 1.39 [1.16, 1.66]; boys: OR = 1.76 [1.44, 2.14]), and attempt [girls: OR = 1.70 (1.32, 2.19); boys: OR = 3.13, (2.37, 4.15)]. These relationships became mostly non-significant after controlling for relevant risk factors for suicidality. The adjusted odds ratios showed no relationship between concussion and suicidal ideation [girls: OR = 1.11 (0.86, 1.44); boys: OR = 1.24 (0.92, 1.69)] or planning (girls: OR = 1.07 [0.82, 1.40]; boys: OR = 1.12 [0.82, 1.55]); but a significant relationship with suicide attempts in boys [OR = 1.98 (1.28, 3.04)], but not girls [OR = 1.05 (0.74, 1.49)].</sec><sec>Conclusions and RelevanceThere was an association between concussion and suicidality in U.S. high school students; however, after controlling for other variables (e.g., depression, sexual abuse/assault, illicit drug use), there was no association between concussion and suicidality aside from a significant relationship between concussion and attempts in boys.</sec>}

   abstract = {Sexual violence and physical fighting are independent risk factors for suicidal behaviors among adolescents. However, whether the concurrence of these two risk factors increases the risk of suicidal behaviors among ideators, and by how much that risk increases are unknown. This study analyzed data from the 2019 National Youth Risk Behavior Surveys. Students who reported having seriously considered attempting suicide in the past year were included (n = 1755). The associations between physical fighting/sexual violence status and the risk of suicide attempt/plan/attempt requiring medical intervention were estimated. The concurrence of physical fighting and sexual violence substantially increased the relative risk of attempted suicide (adjusted relative risk, adRR = 1.99, 95% CI 1.72, 2.29) and attempted suicide requiring medical intervention (adRR = 4.07, 95% CI 2.84, 5.85; subgroup analyses: among women, adRR = 3.33, 95% CI 2.14, 5.17; among men, adRR = 6.25, 95% CI 3.32, 12.28). Among students who had experienced concurrent physical fighting and sexual violence, more suicide-attempt-associated health-risk behaviors were reported by men (median = 14) than women (median = 12) (p = 0.0023). The concurrence of physical fighting and sexual violence among adolescent suicide ideators was shown to be significantly associated with an increased risk of attempted suicide. A wide variety of health-risk behaviors were shown to cluster with the concurrence of physical fighting and sexual violence. This was especially the case among men, consistent with their higher rate of attempted suicide requiring medical intervention.},

abstract = {Abstract BACKGROUND Food insecurity (FI) rates in the United States are particularly high among households with children. This research set aims to analyze if high school students experiencing FI had higher risk for mental health and suicidal behaviors. METHODS Using combined data from 11 states that conducted the 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, a total of 26,962 and 24,051 high school students were used to estimate race/ethnicity and sex-stratified prevalence ratios (PRs) from Poisson regression models. A single-question was used to measure the exposure of FI and outcomes of mental health and suicidal behaviors. RESULTS Overall, 10.8\% of students reported FI. Students experiencing FI had increased risk for all mental health and suicide behavior outcomes, regardless of their race/ethnicity or sex. PRs ranged from 1.9 (95\% confidence interval [CI]:1.8, 2.0) to 3.1 (CI: 2.7, 3.6). Among males, PRs for the association between FI and all outcomes were highest among non-Hispanic black students (PRs ranged from 2.4 [CI: 1.7, 3.2] to 5.5 [CI: 2.3, 13.3]). Among females, PRs were highest among non-Hispanic white students (PRs ranged from 1.9 [CI:1.7, 2.1] to 3.6 [CI:2.9, 4.5]). CONCLUSIONS FI is consistently associated with mental health and suicidal behaviors among different subgroups of students.}

abstract = {Supervised machine learning has been increasingly used in psychology and psychiatry research. Machine learning offers an important advantage over traditional statistical analyses: statistical model training in example data to enhance predictions in external test data. Additional advantages include advanced, improved statistical algorithms, and empirical methods to select a smaller set of predictor variables. Yet machine learning researchers often use large numbers of predictor variables, without using theory to guide variable selection. Such approach leads to Type I error, spurious findings, and decreased generalizability. We discuss the importance of theory to the psychology field. We offer suggestions for using theory to drive variable selection and data analyses using machine learning in psychological research, including an example from the cyberpsychology field.}

  abstract = 	 {An important question in feature selection is whether a selection strategy recovers the “true” set of features, given enough data. We study this question in the context of the popular Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso) feature selection strategy. In particular, we consider the scenario when the model is misspecified so that the learned model is linear while the underlying real target is nonlinear. Surprisingly, we prove that under certain conditions, Lasso is still able to recover the correct features in this case. We also carry out numerical studies to empirically verify the theoretical results and explore the necessity of the conditions under which the proof holds.}

   abstract = {Socioecological approaches to psychology are broadly applicable to several pressing societal issues. Through a more comprehensive account of contextual processes that unfold at various ecological levels over the life course, these approaches can enhance ecological validity, facilitate knowledge translation, and expedite the transition to a future where equity is central to psychological science. This special issue of Translational Issues in Psychological Science explores how socioecological approaches can be used to address societal inequity in various domains (e.g., mental and physical health, education, and juvenile justice) with cutting-edge methodological techniques that account for complexity in multilevel systems. The articles included in this special issue exemplify what is possible when psychological research moves beyond individual perceptions and intrapsychic processes to explore outcomes as a function of the dynamic interplay between a person and their environment. If psychological science is more sensitive to the contextual factors that drive human behavior, then research will more accurately reflect real-world settings, translation to practice will be more impactful, and interventions will be better positioned to reduce systemic inequities.

ABSTRACT={Objective: Early identification of individuals who are at risk for suicide is crucial in supporting suicide prevention. Machine learning is emerging as a promising approach to support this objective. Machine learning is broadly defined as a set of mathematical models and computational algorithms designed to automatically learn complex patterns between predictors and outcomes from example data, without being explicitly programmed to do so. The model's performance continuously improves over time by learning from newly available data.Method: This concept paper explores how machine learning approaches applied to healthcare data obtained from electronic health records, including billing and claims data, can advance our ability to accurately predict future suicidal behavior.Results: We provide a general overview of machine learning concepts, summarize exemplar studies, describe continued challenges, and propose innovative research directions.Conclusion: Machine learning has potential for improving estimation of suicide risk, yet important challenges and opportunities remain. Further research can focus on incorporating evolving methods for addressing data imbalances, understanding factors that affect generalizability across samples and healthcare systems, expanding the richness of the data, leveraging newer machine learning approaches, and developing automatic learning systems.}

abstract = {Background
Joiner’s interpersonal theory of suicide (IPTS) proposes that suicide results from the combination of a perception of burdening others, social alienation, and the capability for self-harm. The theory gained some empirical support, however the overall model has yet to be tested. This study aimed to test the main predictions of IPTS in a large community sample of Israeli adolescents.
Method
1196 Israeli Jewish and Arab high-school pupils participating in the SEYLE project completed a self-report questionnaire measuring perceived burdensomeness, thwarted belongingness, health risk behaviors, and non-suicidal self-injury (risk variables), and suicidal ideation and suicide attempts (outcome measures). The data were tested in cross-sectional regression models.
Results
Consistent with IPTS, perceived burdensomeness was found to interact with thwarted belongingness, predicting suicidal ideation. Depression mediated most of the effect of thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness on suicidal ideation. Acquired capability for self-harm, as measured by health risk behaviors and direct non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors, predicted suicide attempt. However, this mechanism operated independently from ideation rather than in interaction with it, at variance with IPTS-based predictions.
Limitations
The cross-sectional design precludes conclusions about causality and directionality. Proxy measures were used to test the interpersonal theory constructs.
Conclusion
The findings support some of the IPTS predictions but not all, and imply two separate pathways for suicidal behavior in adolescents: one related to internalizing psychopathology and the other to self-harm behaviors. This conceptualization has clinical implications for the differential identification of adolescents at risk for suicidal behavior and for the development of prevention strategies.}
