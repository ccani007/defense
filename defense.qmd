## Definitions
::: {.fragment}
### Adolescents (10-19 years of age)
- Is the phase of life between childhood and adulthood [@cdc]
- Adolescents experience rapid physical, cognitive and psychosocial growth [@cdc]
:::
::: {.fragment}
### Suicide Ideation
Any self-reported thoughts of engaging in suicide-related behaviors [@ocarroll1996]  

- Considering
- Planning suicide
:::

::: {.fragment}
### Suicide Attempts
Any act that is self-inflicted and potentially injurious, for which there is evidence of **intent to die** [@silverman2007]

## Background 


## Signifance of the study 


## Research aims
1. Identify the critical risk factors for adolescent suicide morbidity from a set of 99 risk behavior predictors with machine learning classification algorithms.   

2. Identify the **best** machine learning methodology to classify adolescents who attempted and considered suicide according to its classification performance (ROC, overall accuracy, and the Kappa value). 

3. Compare the performance of an a priori-determined model to models informed by feature selection from the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator method.   

4. Identify if there are differences in the critical risk factors for suicide ideation and suicide attempts.

## Methods 



::: {.panel-tabset}
### Logistic Regression 
- Model the outcome as a linear function of the predictors [@burkov2019]. 

- The sigmoid function is applied to adjust the predictions to stay between 0 and 1 [@burkov2019]

- The predictors are selected from past literature modeling YRBSS data 

![](images/logistic.png)  

### Lasso regression
- Estimates the coefficients aiming at zero, this means that it uses shrinkage [@James2013].  

- It is extremely useful for variable importance, selection, and regularization [@James2013]. 

- This technique will select only relevant coefficients [@James2013]. 


### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
-  KNN will assign class membership to a data point with the majority vote of its K-nearest neighbors. 

![](images/knn.png)

- The three closest points to the test observation are identified, and it is predicted that the observation belongs to the most common class, in this case, blue circles [@James2013]

### Classification Trees 
- Divides the feature space into non-overlapping rectangular regions with similar response rates that can later be used for prediction [@Greenwell2022].

### Random Forest 
- Random forest consists of hundreds or thousands of independently grown decision trees generated from different bootstrap samples from the training data [@Greenwell2022].

### Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Same concept of Random Forest but..

- Each additional tree added to the model partially fixes the errors made by the previous trees until the maximum number of trees are combined [@burkov2019]

## Ethical Implications 
 Minimal human subjects concerns
 
 1. The original data was not collected to answer the present research question
 2. Acknowledge the ownership of the original data. 
 3. Accidentally losing or destroying the data.
